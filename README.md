# Libft

The libft project at school 42 is one of the initial projects students undertake as part of their curriculum. It involves creating their own library of functions in the C programming language. The project aims not only to implement basic functions similar to those found in the standard C library, such as string and character manipulation, but also to teach memory management, pointer manipulation, and fundamental data structures. Additionally, the project is assessed for adherence to coding norms and the presence of detailed documentation for each function. It serves as a critical component of learning at school 42, influencing further studies and the successful completion of subsequent projects.

## Key Points

- **C Programming**: The entire project is written in C, adhering to strict coding standards and memory management practices.
- **Makefile Requirements**: A Makefile is included to compile the source files with specific flags and rules.
- **Testing and Stability**: Functions undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are stable, avoiding unexpected crashes and managing memory correctly.
- **Practical Application**: Functions developed in this project are utilized in subsequent 42 projects, providing practical benefits.

## Educational Value

This project enables students to:

- Implement and comprehend fundamental algorithms and data structures.
- Gain a deeper understanding of standard C library functions through their recreation.
- Follow stringent coding standards and adopt best practices in software development.
- Efficiently manage memory and prevent memory leaks.
- Prepare for real-world programming challenges by constructing a robust library of reusable functions.
